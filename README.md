This is a plugin for Craft CMS that enables the site to recieve webmentions. Some config will be needed.

Use composer: 
curl -sS https://getcomposer.org/installer | php
php composer.phar install

You must change the type and section ids within the controller to match your own site.

Tested with Quill https://quill.p3k.io/
